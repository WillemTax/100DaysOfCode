# 100DaysOfCode-OnePager
haven't figured out what to build (yet) but time will tell!

First idea
-
- Building a simple(?) webpage that displays the date 100 days from now, quite usefull for people like me who will follow the 100-days-of-code-challenge.

No idea how (and when since I need more knowledge first) this repo will expand! 







DAY 1/100
24 October 2018
-
First day of coding real stuff! Used my 'simple' design of a Progress-indicator-card (or something) I created yesterday as the base of this project. Looking .... But it's something! 

What I learned today:
-
Div's, padding, margin, google fonts, ... how to wreck a github repo... 

See you tomorrow!
