# 100DaysOfCode-OnePager
haven't figured out what to build (yet) but time will tell!

First idea
-
- Building a simple(?) webpage that displays the date 100 days from now, quite usefull for people like me who will follow the 100-days-of-code-challenge.

No idea how (and when since I need more knowledge first) this repo will expand!

DAY 5/100

Also spend more time on FreeCodeCamp and learned ...... see below ;)

What I learned today:
-
That I kinda messed up this project by starting too early. No problem, the second time your try stuff is always better. However, will be striving for *first time right!*

DAY 3/100
