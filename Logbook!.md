# 100DaysOfCode-OnePager
haven't figured out what to build (yet) but time will tell!

First idea
-
- Building a simple(?) webpage that displays the date 100 days from now, quite usefull for people like me who will follow the 100-days-of-code-challenge.

No idea how (and when since I need more knowledge first) this repo will expand! 



DAY 3/100
26 October 2018

Finished the CSS chapter of FreeCodeCamp... In my project I defined a main-color variable, thought that might come in handy if I decide to change colors! Didn't add the fallback for all those IE-people out there ;)

What I learned today:
-
Div's, padding, margin, google fonts, ... how to wreck a github repo...

DAY 2/100
25 October 2018

Spend an hour or 1,5 to expend my project. More fiddling with placing text in my 'card'. Struggled some time till i found out i 'selected' a divclass with a # instead of a . (or the other way around, anyways..)

What I learned today:

Div's, padding, margin, google fonts, ... how to wreck a github repo...

First day of coding real stuff! Used my 'simple' design of a Progress-indicator-card (or something) I created yesterday as the base of this project. Looking .... But it's something!

See you tomorrow!
